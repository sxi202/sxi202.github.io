          <h3>Rapper Nispey Hussle Killed</h3>
          <p>Posted on April 5, 2019</p>
          <p>Nipsey Hussle was an American rapper and song writer from Los Angeles who   was killed on April 3, creating an uproar in the black community.</p>

          <p>His caused of death was as a result of obtaining gunshot wounds to the head and torso. According to Stacia Brown who wrote an article to The Washington Post, the conspiracy theory of Hussle being killed due to his connection with Dr. Sebi and HIV, proved to be false.</p>

          <p>Many people believed that the documentary Hussle was working on with the herbal doctor, would prove that he was killed by government officials, for having the cure for HIV aids. A claim that would have dismantled the multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical empire that ran the country.</p>

          <p>She explained in her article that this type of response from the black community was a form of grief where many were bewildered by his death as they searched for a deeper explanation. Hussle quickly moved from a hero status to a martyr. The murder suspect Eric Holder, Hussle’s best friend, was arrested and charged for his friend’s death and attempted murder for bystanders who got injured. However, Holder pleaded not guilty on Thursday to these charges with a $5 million bail.</p>

          <p>Posted March 29,2019</p>
          <p>A man was in court on Wednesday to answer for kidnapping 13-year-old Jayme Closs and killing her parents in Wisconsin on Oct. 15, 2018.</p>

          <p>James Patterson pleaded guilty on two counts of first-degree intentional homicide one count of kidnapping. The remaining charges of burglary were dropped, which was ruled as a life sentence for the accused.</p>

          <p>After three months into her disappearance she was able to escape from her kidnapper’s house. By the time she was able to get to safety an arrested was made against Patterson within 30 minutes. Upon exiting the courtroom, his last words were ‘Bye Jayme’ but she was not there.</p>

          <p>According to The New York Times, Patterson had trouble finding direction and appeared to lack companionship.</p>

          <p>“Former high school classmates and teachers described Mr. Patterson as a quiet, bookish boy who struggled to find his way after graduation. He enlisted in the Marines but was sent home from boot camp after five weeks. Neighbors said he bounced from job to job and spent much of his time alone.”</p>

          <p>What are some of your thoughts about this person? Do you think he’s mentally challenged or he plain evil?</p>

          <h3>College admission scandal leads to arrests</h3>
          <p>Posted March 22,2019</p>
          <p>About 50 people were arrested and charged including many celebrities, famous coaches and wealthy parents for their participation in one of America’s biggest college admission scandal the country has ever seen.</p>

          <p>Lori Loughlin, the wife of Mossimo Giuannulli were reported by People that the entire family went completely under the radar as they tried to avoid the on-going tension of the issue. Olivia Jade, 19 and her sister Isabella Rose, 20, daughters of Loughlin both dropped out of the University of Southern California which was one of the implicated universities.,</p>

          <p>“The whole family is still laying low at their Bel Air home. Lori and Mossimo both have court dates in Boston next week. It’s still a very stressful time for them all,” a source told Aurelie Corinthios, who wrote an article for People.</p>

          <p>The sting lead by William Rick Singer called ‘Operation Varsity Blue’ took place at The Keys, his college admission prep company. Those arrested included two SAT/ACT administrators, one exam proctor, nine coaches, one college administrator and 33 parents.<p>

          <p>Many people were disturbed by the actions of the elites and some even shared their views of understanding why the rich would always be ahead.</p>

          <p>Elle Fromm told “PBS News Hour,” “You know, maybe it used to be your parents donated a library. And now it’s you have got a fixer who bumps your SAT score up 400 points. But, yes, I’m not that surprised.”</p>

          <p>To live in a society that rewards the rich for their minimal efforts would endlessly encourage the cycle of inequality. If people at the top of the pyramid continue to teach their peers a way of lying and cheating to get to the top, then the wheels of morality would be highly skewed. Life cannot persist like this and such behavior requires an overall change of perception. What are some of your thoughts on the scandal?</p>

          <h3>Plane crashes in Fort Lauderdale</h3>
          <p>Posted on March 8,2019</p>
          <p>A small banner plane crashed into a Fort Lauderdale condominium last Friday, killing the pilot and destroying a resident’s kitchen. No other people were hurt.</p>

          <p>Derek Morgan, 28, was a resident of Washington state before moving six weeks ago to South Florida to accomplish more hours for his commercial pilot license. Many of his co-workers, friends and close-friends remembered him as someone jovial and warm to be around.</p>

          <p>“It’s a tragedy. It’s a tragedy for the family. It’s a tragedy for all of us. He traveled across the country just to get here to do some flight hours,” said Patrick Phipps, one of Morgan’s friend.</p>

          <p>According to witnesses they told the Sun Sentinel that the plane’s banner was caught on a nearby building which sent it hurtling into The Berkley South. It landed between the 16th and 17th floors before toppling onto the pool deck that was still undergoing construction.</p>

          <p>The Piper PA-25 was registered to Ariel Banners Inc., which was based at North Perry Airport. After the crash all residents were evacuated from the building in fear for a gas leak. Once a fire threat was clear and further investigations were done they were not allotted back inside until it was safe to do so.</p>
