          <p>I am a born and raised Jamaican who migrated to the United States of America for college. At the University of Miami, I major in Journalism and minor in Public Relations. I am passionate about writing and admire the literatures of arts with my favorite being poetry. In my college experience I became involved in different activities like UMTV, where I was apart of UniMiami and NewsVision. For further on-campus involvements I look forward in being apart of The Miami Hurricane, which is the universityâ€™s newspaper. I aspire to be in a career field that would bring me great joy and inspire me to strengthen my different skill levels. I am excited for what the future holds, as I continue to ponder on the many directions I could follow suit in.</p>
